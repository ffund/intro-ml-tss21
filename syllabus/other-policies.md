### Other important policies 

#### Inclusion

The NYU Tandon School values an inclusive and equitable environment for all our students. I hope to foster a sense of community in this class and consider it a place where individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious and political affiliations, and abilities will be treated with respect. It is my intent that all students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.

#### Disability

If you are student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.  You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations.  Information about the Moses Center can be found at www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center is located at 726 Broadway on the 3rd floor.

Note for those who require accommodations for timed assessments: the exams in this class are timed exams.

#### Illness or other exceptional situation

If you are experiencing an illness or any other situation that might affect your academic performance in a class,  please contact the student advocate: https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy who will reach out to the course instructor on your behalf for accommodations when warranted.

Students who need an excused absence (e.g. an extended deadline on an assignment due to illness) should complete the "Excused Absence" form on the Student Advocacy website.
