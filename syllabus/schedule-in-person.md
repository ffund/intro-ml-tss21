### Time commitment

This is a 3-credit course. During a fall or spring semester, the average student should spend at least 3 hours/week/credit â†’ 9 hours/week for a 3 credit course. A typical week will include:

 - pre-lecture reading/activity (some weeks) or study time (30-60 minutes)
 - a "chalkboard lecture" about 120 minutes long
 - a "Colab lecture" video about 90-120 minutes long
 - a homework problem set (estimated time: 1-2 hours)
 - a lab assignment (estimated time: 2-3 hours per week)

A student who is not very comfortable with the prerequisites may have to spend more time than the estimate above in order to do well.
