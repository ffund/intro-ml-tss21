* Lab 10: released 4/17, due 4/30


### Time commitment

This is a 3-credit course. During a fall or spring semester, the average student should spend at least 3 hours/week/credit → 9 hours/week for a 3 credit course. A typical week will include:

 - pre-lecture reading/activity (some weeks) or study time (0.5-1 hours)
 - a "chalkboard lecture" about 2-2.5 hours long
 - a "Colab lecture" video about 1.5 hours long
 - a homework problem set (estimated time: 1-2 hours)
 - a lab assignment (estimated time: 2-3 hours per week, i.e. about 6 or 7 hours per lab assignment)

A student who is not very comfortable with the prerequisites may have to spend more time than the estimate above in order to do well.
