### Academic integrity and collaboration policies

For general academic integrity guidelines, please review the [NYU Tandon Student Code of Conduct](https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct) (n.b. the academic misconduct section). 

For this course in particular:

* Students are expected to do all assignments individually. If a student shows or gives his/her work to another, then both students are considered to be cheating.

If you need help with an assignment, these are the ways in which you are *permitted* to get help from someone else:

* You may ask questions about homework/lab assignments on the Q&A site (Ed). It's OK to include a partial answer or some details about reasoning in your question, even though it is visible to the rest of the class - you don't have to worry about "giving away an answer" when asking a question. You can visit an office hour with course staff and ask questions there.
* You may discuss homework/lab assignments with classmates or other people who are not course staff as follows: *without sharing or directly showing your materials* (question, solution, failed attempt, data, figures), you can verbally discuss with other students the approach you used to solve a particular problem. (A useful guideline is: if there is a screen involved in this discussion, it's not allowed.)

But, these ways of getting help are *not permitted*:

* You may not share your homework/lab with anyone else by email or other private communication channel. (Not even for "comparison", not a partial answer, not a screenshot of your answer, not an incorrect answer, not even a question variant with no answer...) Note that if multiple students submit the same work, they will *all* get a zero, even if one of them can show that they originally did the work - because sharing the work is *also* against course policy.
* You may not post questions on CourseHero, Chegg, or other sites - the course Q&A site on Ed is the only place you are allowed to post questions about homework assignments. 
* You are not allowed to use solved homework or lab assignments from a current or previous semester (whether from a friend, or that you find online).  (Not even for "comparison", not a partial answer, etc...)
* In most cases, AI assistance is not permitted (see specifics below).
* You may not *attempt* to use any unauthorized assistance on exams. Note that even if your attempt is unsuccessful (e.g. you open ChatGPT but are "caught" before you can copy and paste a question into it), you will earn a zero grade on the exam and a record in the Office of Student Life and Services. 

Also note: 

* After the class ends, some students like to share their solutions to programming assignments as part of an online "portfolio", to show off their work. However, you may only share the part that you wrote - you may not share the parts of the "template" (code or text) that were written by me.

#### Policy on use of AI

You are permitted to use AI assistance for the following tasks:

* computer translation between English and another language, e.g. you may write an explanation for a homework problem or lab assignment in another language and then submit a direct translation to English using Google Translate or a similar service. (Note: this does not include "cleaning up" or rephrasing text, which is not allowed - only direct translation is allowed. You shouldn't "clean up" text because (1) I don't care about your spelling, grammar, or vocabulary, and (2) if I am asking for an open-ended response, I want to hear *your* voice, not an LLM's voice.)
* to generate Python code for plotting and visualization. You are fully responsible for any figures or visualizations you submit, including making sure their appearance is reasonable and the data in them is correct. But, you are permitted to use an AI assistant such as ChatGPT or Gemini to help you generate `matplotlib` or `seaborn` code to make your plots look the way you want. If you do use an AI assistant, you must include your LLM prompt in your submission.

With the exception of the tasks listed above, AI assistance is not permitted in this course.

Here is some free advice for students who are using AI assistance on homework anyway (even though it is not permitted in this course):

The sequence of assignments in this course is calibrated for human learners, to gradually learn the content by progressively building on what they have already mastered. If you do the homework problem sets and lab assignments yourself (especially if you find them challenging!), you are "exercising" your brain in ways that make your abilities stronger, and prepare you to attempt more difficult problems (including problems that are outside the capabilities of current gen AI models). If you use AI extensively on un-proctored assessments, like homework problem sets and lab assignments, you will instead experience [cognitive atrophy](https://spencerauthor.com/cognitive-atrophy/) - your cognitive ability (as it relates to the skills in this couse) gets weaker, instead of stronger. You will likely find yourself unprepared for difficult problems on the proctored exams, where you are not allowed to use AI. 

Some students feel like they are "learning" when they study the answer that an AI assistant provides. In general, reading material (lecture notes, homework solutions) is a popular study strategy because it is familiar, and feels comfortable. However, it is known to be much less effective in creating strong, stable memory representations than *retrieval practice*.  The cognitive processes for receiving information into your brain (i.e., watching videos or reading text) are different from the processes for retrieving information from your brain (i.e., taking tests, solving problems). While receiving information can help you feel familiar with content (when re-reading you may feel like "I've seen this problem before!" or "I know this!"), it is much less effective at creating strong, stable memory than practice retrieving information. This is why if you "learn" primarily by reading/listening, even if you feel very comfortable with the material in that context, you may still do poorly on exams (where you are asked to retrieve and use information) or in other new contexts.

Retrieval practice is like going to the gym. It's not most people's favorite activity because it requires effort and time, and is often uncomfortable, but it is necessary for growing and learning.

By the way, retrieval practice - much more so than re-reading - has been shown to create memories that are more resistant to stress e.g. the stress of an exam setting, or a job interview.

With all that in mind, are there ways to use AI that will cause less "cognitive atrophy" than other ways? Yes, here are some suggestions specifically for coding problems - 

* Always attempt to solve a problem on your own first, without any AI usage. This will help you understand your own capabilities more precisely, i.e. to what extent are you dependent on the AI?
* If you are going to ask an AI assistant for help, instead of giving it the entire problem and letting it give you an entire solution, prompt it with a small piece of the problem that you know you will need, so that it gives you one or two lines of code to solve *that* part of the problem. This way, you are still practicing the skill of planning out the solution on your own, even if you don't know how to write code to realize that solution.
* A week or two after submitting a solution using AI assistance, reset the submission (in PrairieLearn: open the workspace and click the "Reset" button) and re-attempt the problem without looking at your previous submission.

Outside of coding problems, I also suggest you avoid using AI as a "tutor" since it does not have the benefit of the context of the rest of the course material - it does not know the specific points of emphasis in this course, what we have/have not learned, or how we have related specific concepts to one another. Instead of using AI: 

* When you answer a question on PrairieLearn, scroll down to the "Correct Answer" panel. In many cases, this will have an explanation that is **written by your instructor**.
* If you don't understand something in the lecture, lab, or homework, post a question on Ed to get an explanation from your instructor or a course assistant.
* Or, visit an office hour on Zoom for a "live" Q&A with humans.

For open-ended text questions:

* Don't use AI assistance. You are not graded on spelling, grammar, or on how eloquently you describe your observations - so even though an AI may be "better" than you on those elements of writing, it's not relevant. You are graded on what *you* have observed or understood based on the specific activities you are writing about, and an AI is *not* better than you at *that*. (Besides for AI use being forbidden, AI-generated text anyways tends to score poorly on these questions.)

#### Violation of academic integrity policies

The course staff wants to spend their time and effort supporting students who want to learn, not policing students' avoidance of learning. However, when we *do* detect a violation of these policies (e.g. on grading a manually graded question on a homework or lab assignment, on "spot checks" of autograded questions, or on manual review of exams), we take it very seriously.

* on the first instance of a violation of these academic integrity policies, a zero grade will be applied for the assessment. Also, a record of the incident will be kept in the Office of Student Life and Services by the Office of Student Advocacy, as described in the [Student Code of Conduct](https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct).
* on a second instance, an F grade will be assigned for the course. Also, a record of the incident will be kept in the Office of Student Life and Services by the Office of Student Advocacy, as described in the [Student Code of Conduct](https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct).

By design, the consequence for an academic integrity violation is always worse than the consequence for not knowing an answer - if you don't know an answer to a question, you may earn a zero on just that question. If you violate the academic integrity policies of the course, you will earn a zero on the entire assessment (problem set, lab assignment, or exam). There are no opportunities to "make up" points lost on an assignment due to an academic integrity violation.
