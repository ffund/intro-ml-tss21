### Academic integrity and collaboration policies

For general academic integrity guidelines, please review the [NYU Tandon Student Code of Conduct](https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct) (n.b. the academic misconduct section). 

For this course in particular:

* You may ask questions about homework/lab assignments on the Q&A site (Ed). It's OK to include a partial answer or some details about reasoning in your question, even though it is visible to the rest of the class - you don't have to worry about "giving away an answer" when asking a question.
* You may discuss homework/lab assignments with classmates as follows: you can verbally explain to other students the approach you used to solve a particular problem, without sharing or directly showing your materials (question, solution, failed attempt, data, figures).
* You may not share your homework/lab with anyone else by email or other private communication channel. (Not even for "comparison", not a partial answer, not an incorrect answer, not even a question variant with no answer...)
* You may not post questions on CourseHero, Chegg, or other sites - the course Q&A site on Ed is the only place you are allowed to post questions about homework assignments. 
* You are not allowed to use solved homework or lab assignments from a previous semester (whether from a friend, or that you find online).  (Not even for "comparison", not a partial answer, etc...)
* You may not *attempt* to use any unauthorized assistance on exams. Note that even if your attempt is unsuccessful (e.g. you open ChatGPT but are "caught" before you can copy and paste a question into it), you will earn a zero grade on the exam and a record in the Office of Student Life and Services. 
* After the class ends, some students like to share their solutions to programming assignments as part of an online "portfolio", to show off their work. However, you may only share the part that you wrote - you may not share the parts of the "template" (code or text) that were written by me.

#### Policy on use of AI

You are permitted to use AI assistance for the following tasks:

* computer translation between English and another language, e.g. you may write an explanation for a homework problem or lab assignment in another language and then submit a direct translation to English using Google Translate or a similar service. (Note: this does not include "cleaning up" or rephrasing text, which is not allowed - only direct translation is allowed. You shouldn't "clean up" text because (1) I don't care about your spelling, grammar, or vocabulary, and (2) if I am asking for an open-ended response, I want to hear *your* voice, not an LLM's voice.)
* to generate Python code for plotting and visualization. You are fully responsible for any figures or visualizations you submit, including making sure their appearance is reasonable and the data in them is correct. But, you are permitted to use an AI assistant such as ChatGPT or Gemini to help you generate `matplotlib` or `seaborn` code to make your plots look the way you want.

With the exception of the tasks listed above, AI assistance is not permitted in this course.

The sequence of assignments in this course is calibrated for human learners, to gradually learn the content by progressively building on what they have already mastered. If you use AI on un-proctored assessments, like homework problem sets and lab assignments, you will likely find yourself unprepared for the proctored exams, where you are not allowed to use AI. 

Instead of using an AI "tutor" (which often makes subtle mistakes, and won't emphasize the things that your instructor wants you to pay attention to), please use the human assistance that is available to you in this course:

* When you answer a question on PrairieLearn, scroll down to the "Correct Answer" panel. In many cases, this will have an explanation that is **written by your instructor**.
* If you don't understand something in the lecture, lab, or homework, post a question on Ed to get an explanation from your instructor or a course assistant.
* Or, visit an office hour on Zoom for a "live" Q&A with humans.

#### Violation of academic integrity policies

The course staff wants to spend their time and effort supporting students who want to learn, not policing students' avoidance of learning. However, when we *do* detect a violation of these policies (e.g. on grading a manually graded question on a homework or lab assignment, on "spot checks" of autograded questions, or on manual review of exams), we take it very seriously.

* on the first instance of a violation of these academic integrity policies, a zero grade will be applied for the assessment. Also, a record of the incident will be kept in the Office of Student Life and Services by the Office of Student Advocacy, as described in the [Student Code of Conduct](https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct).
* on a second instance, an F grade will be assigned for the course. Also, a record of the incident will be kept in the Office of Student Life and Services by the Office of Student Advocacy, as described in the [Student Code of Conduct](https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct).

By design, the consequence for an academic integrity violation is always worse than the consequence for not knowing an answer - if you don't know an answer to a question, you may earn a zero on just that question. If you violate the academic integrity policies of the course, you will earn a zero on the entire assessment (problem set, lab assignment, or exam).
