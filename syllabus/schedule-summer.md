Fraida Fund ffund@nyu.edu (370 Jay St, Room 936). The best way to reach me is to post on Ed or to visit my office hour (see Brightspace calendar for dates and Zoom links).

### Instruction mode

Online synchronous (live Zoom meetings), with some online asynchronous content. (The live Zoom meetings will be recorded.)

### Schedule

* "Chalkboard lecture" Wednesday 11:00 AM - 1:30 PM (NYC time) live on Zoom.
* "Colab lecture" video will be released online after the chalkboard lecture.
* Homework problem sets will be released on Fridays at 1PM, and will be due 9 days later (on a Sunday) at midnight.
* Lab assignments will be released on Fridays for even-numbered topics (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and will be due 13 days later (on a Thursday) at midnight (except the last lab, which follows a slightly different schedule).
* Office hours: See Brightspace calendar for dates and Zoom links

For the Summer 2025 semester, a tentative schedule (subject to change) is:

The anticipated schedule of lab assignments will be:

* Lab 2: released 5/30, due 6/12
* Lab 4: released 6/13, due 6/26
* Lab 6: released 6/27, due 7/10
* Lab 8: released 7/11, due 7/24
* Lab 10: released 7/25, due **8/10** (Sunday, after the final exam)


### Time commitment

This is a 3-credit course. During a fall or spring semester, the average student should spend at least 3 hours/week/credit â†’ 9 hours/week for a 3 credit course. A typical week will include:

 - pre-lecture reading/activity (some weeks) or study time (0.5-1 hours)
 - a "chalkboard lecture" about 2-2.5 hours long
 - a "Colab lecture" video about 1.5 hours long
 - a homework problem set (estimated time: 1-2 hours)
 - a lab assignment (estimated time: 2-3 hours per week, i.e. about 6 or 7 hours per lab assignment)

A student who is not very comfortable with the prerequisites may have to spend more time than the estimate above in order to do well. 

In the summer semester, which is 2 weeks shorter but the same number of credits, the estimated time commitment is slightly higher, especially around the midterm and final exams.
