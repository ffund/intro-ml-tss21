</header>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>This course is an introduction to the field of machine learning,
covering fundamental techniques for classification, regression,
dimensionality reduction, clustering, and model selection. A broad range
of algorithms will be covered, such as linear and logistic regression,
neural networks, deep learning, support vector machines, tree-based
methods, expectation maximization, and principal components analysis.
The course will include hands-on exercises with real data from different
application areas (e.g. text, audio, images). Students will learn to
train and validate machine learning models and analyze their
performance.</p>

<h3 id="time-commitment">Time commitment</h3>
<p>This is a 3-credit course. During a fall or spring semester, the
average student should spend at least 3 hours/week/credit → 9 hours/week
for a 3 credit course. A typical week will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-lecture reading/activity (some weeks) or study time (30-60
minutes)</li>
<li>a “chalkboard lecture” about 120 minutes long</li>
<li>a “Colab lecture” video about 90-120 minutes long</li>
<li>a homework problem set (estimated time: 1-2 hours)</li>
<li>a lab assignment (estimated time: 2-3 hours per week)</li>
</ul>
<p>A student who is not very comfortable with the prerequisites may have
to spend more time than the estimate above in order to do well.</p>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>You do not have to buy a textbook. A list of references, available to
you for free with your NYU account, is on the course site: <a
href="../notes/0-books.html">Textbooks and other resources</a>.</p>
<h3 id="platforms">Platforms</h3>
<p>This course uses several required third-party platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>demos and labs in this course run on Google Colab</li>
<li>homework will be on <a
href="https://us.prairielearn.com/pl">PrairieLearn</a> and exams on <a
href="https://us.prairietest.com/">PrairieTest</a></li>
<li>Q&amp;A will be on <a href="https://edstem.org/">Ed</a></li>
<li>other platforms may be used for lab assignments</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the Content &gt; Course Tools section of the Brightspace
course site for details, and to join our course on these platforms.</p>
<p>All of the executable content in this course should run on these
platforms, not on your own laptop. The course staff is not able to
support the individual operating systems, Python versions, and Python
library versions installed on students’ personal devices.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Students enrolled in Intro ML are expected to have
undergraduate-level probability and linear algebra. A more detailed list
of specific math concepts that are required is available here: <a
href="../notes/0-prerequisite-review.html">Prerequisite review</a>.</p>
<p>Students should also have programming experience, preferably in
Python.</p>
<p>No prior experience in machine learning is expected.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>In the fall and spring semesters, the overall numeric course grade is
determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework problem sets: 25%</li>
<li>Lab assignments: 25%</li>
<li>Midterm exam: 25%</li>
<li>Final exam: 25%</li>
<li>Extra credit: See below</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, your letter grade is determined according to the following
chart:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Minimum grade required for…</th>
<th>is…</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td>90</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>B-</td>
<td>70</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>C+</td>
<td>64</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>C</td>
<td>60</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(grades are rounded up if they are within 0.999 of the required
grade.)</p>
<p>The same grading policy is applied to every student, regardless of
personal circumstances. There are no opportunities for “extra” work or
for personal grading schemes different than the one described above. If
it important to you to earn a specific grade, then it is up to you to
make sure the work you submit is at that level.</p>
<h4 id="homework-problem-sets">Homework problem sets</h4>
<p>There are 10-12 homework problem sets assigned over the course of the
semester. These are always due on Sunday at midnight. Make sure to give
yourself plenty of time, so that in case you have questions or need
help, you have time to ask and get support on Ed well before the
assignment is due. Late work will not be graded for credit unless
recommended by the student advocate (see “Illness or other exceptional
situation”).</p>
<p>There are many problem sets over the course of the semester, so each
one individually carries relatively little weight. Therefore, if life
circumstances on occasion prevent you from fully completing an
assignment before the deadline, the impact on your overall course grade
will be small. There is also an added element of “forgiveness” in the
two lowest problem set grades counting less:</p>
<p>The two lowest grades in the “Homework problem sets” category will be
weighted 50%. For example: if you earn [50, 75, 80, 90, 64] on problem
sets, your weighted problem set average is [75+80+90+(50+64)/2]/4 =
75.5.</p>
<p>Homework problem sets are expected to take 1-2 hours on average. Some
homework problem sets may take less time (e.g. 30 minutes) and some may
take more time (e.g. up to 4 hours). If you are less comfortable with
the math or programming prerequisites for this course, you may find that
homework problem sets take longer than 1-2 hours.</p>
<p>Most homework problems are automatically graded, so you will have
instant feedback regarding your answer (you will know whether it was
correct or not, and in many cases, you will see an explanation of the
correct answer). You have unlimited attempts to submit your answers for
credit before the deadline. Your score will never decrease - once you
have earned credit for a question, you keep that credit even you later
answer the question incorrectly. After the deadline, you may continue to
practice the homework problems, although you won’t earn credit.</p>
<h4 id="lab-assignments">Lab assignments</h4>
<p>There are 4-5 lab assignments over the course of the semester. The
average time expected per lab assignment is 7 hours. Some lab
assignments will take closer to 4-5 hours and some will take closer to
9-10 hours. Note that lab assignments span more than one week.</p>
<p>Make sure to give yourself plenty of time, so that in case you have
questions or need help, you have time to ask and get support on Ed well
before the assignment is due. Late work will not be graded for credit
unless recommended by the student advocate (see “Illness or other
exceptional situation”).</p>
<p>Some of the lab assignments (the first few) will be individual
assignments, and some (near the end of the semester) will be group
assignments. If it is a group assignment, you will receive specific
instructions about group composition requirements, which will be
communicated in advance of the assignment.</p>
<h4 id="exams">Exams</h4>
<p>In the fall and spring semesters, there will be a midterm exam and a
final exam.</p>
<p>On each exam, there will be 100 points that are divided roughly as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>20-30 points: basic computations. You’ll show that you understand
the mathematical operations that are carried out by machine learning
models, by doing some of these operations yourself.</li>
<li>20-30 points: making choices. You’ll show that you know how to
choose a machine learning model, set it up to align with the problem you
are trying to solve, handle the data appropriately, and follow up on
initial results with next steps.</li>
<li>10-15 points: fundamental facts about machine learning models and
how they behave. These questions do not require computation - they will
usually be multiple choice, checkbox, or matching question formats.</li>
<li>5-10 points: questions about specific case studies, visualizations,
and examples in problem sets or lab assignments. These questions are
designed to make sure you “take away” what is intended from these
materials, rather than just earning whatever “points” are associated
with them.</li>
<li>30-35 points: code, including one “easy” and one more complicated
question. The “complicated” question is designed so that you can earn
points progressively, e.g. you can get a small portion of its credit for
doing some basic things correct, some more credit for doing slightly
more difficult things. To earn full credit, you will need to show an
excellent understanding of principles of ML coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will take exams on your own computer, with a proctor
watching.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are enrolled in an in-person section of Intro ML, you will
take the exam in person.</li>
<li>If you are enrolled in an online section of Intro ML, you will also
take the exam in person, UNLESS:
<ul>
<li>you are not enrolled in any in-person course in NYC this semester -
then you may take the exam online, with an online proctor. You will
share your screen and a video view of your environment with the
proctor.</li>
<li>or, if you have another valid reason for requiring online exams, you
should discuss this with me in the first week of the semester (before
the add/drop deadline).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the “live” proctoring, you will record your own screen
while taking the exam, and you will submit this recording after the end
of the exam (this applies to both in person and online exams).</p>
<p>During the exam, you will be permitted to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blank scrap paper (loose sheets, not in a notebook)</li>
<li>2 sheets of 8.5x11 inch-sheet double sided (i.e. 4-page) reference
that you have prepared, with whatever you think you will find useful.
This reference sheet must be printed or handwritten - you should not use
a digital copy. At the end of your exam, you will submit a photo of your
reference sheet along with your exam.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> or <a
href="https://www.desmos.com/scientific">Desmos Scientific
Calculator</a></li>
<li>Python only inside the Jupyter environment on the exam - you may not
use your own IDE/Python terminal, you may not use Colab.</li>
<li>the official scikit-learn API reference pages (any URL that starts
with https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules)</li>
<li>the official numpy API reference pages (any URL that starts with
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference)</li>
<li>the official pandas API reference pages (any URL that starts with
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference)</li>
<li>the official Keras API reference pages (any URL that starts with
https://keras.io/api)</li>
<li>the official Tensorflow API reference pages (any URL that starts
with https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/)</li>
<li>Google Translate (i.e. if you do not understand some question text
or instructions during the exam, you may translate it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan to use these permitted online materials during the exam,
you should open them before the exam begins - you may not use Google
during the exam to find them.</p>
<p>You may not use any other online or offline materials or resources
during the exam. You may not use the course handouts or notebooks
(except for parts you have copied into your ‘reference sheet’). You may
not open the homework problem sets on PrairieLearn during the exam.</p>
<h4 id="extra-credit">Extra credit</h4>
<p>You will have the opportunity to earn extra credit towards your
midterm and final exam scores. This extra credit will be added to your
actual exam score before it is counted in your course grade. For
example, if you earn a 92% on your midterm exam and you have 4 points of
extra credit toward your midterm, then a 96% score will be counted.</p>
<p>You may earn up to 4 points toward your midterm exam and 5 points
toward your final exam.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chalkboard lecture - in person</strong>: in most of our
in-person chalkboard lectures, we will run some live polls - if you
participate in all of the polls in a given lecture, you will earn 0.5
points extra credit.</li>
<li><strong>Chalkboard lecture - online</strong>: for students enrolled
in the online asynchronous section, you may earn the 0.5 points by
correctly answering all of the questions embedded in the chalkboard
lecture video <em>within one week after the video is released</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Colab lecture</strong>: you may earn extra credit points by
answering all of the questions in the Colab lecture videos <em>within
one week after the video is released</em>. Some of the questions only
need to be answered (e.g. “What do you <em>think</em> will happen”);
some need to be answered <em>correctly</em> (and these will be labeled
as “Correct Answer Required”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra credit points are only awarded in 0.5 point increments if you
do everything that is required in a given lesson - you won’t get 0.25
points for participating in half of the polls in a chalkboard lecture,
for example.</p>
<p>Any extra credit you earn from the Week 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 lectures
will be applied to the midterm exam, but capped at 4 points. Any extra
credit you earn from the Week 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 lectures will be
applied to the final exam, but capped at 5 points. The cap means that
even if you miss an opportunity to earn a 0.5 point or two (for example:
you are late to class because of subway delays, and miss a poll as a
result), you won’t be disadvantaged. There are no makeup opportunities
for extra credit points,</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-collaboration-policies">Academic
integrity and collaboration policies</h3>
<p>For general academic integrity guidelines, please review the <a
href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct">NYU
Tandon Student Code of Conduct</a> (n.b. the academic misconduct
section).</p>
<p>For this course in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may ask questions about homework/lab assignments on the Q&amp;A
site (Ed). It’s OK to include a partial answer or some details about
reasoning in your question, even though it is visible to the rest of the
class - you don’t have to worry about “giving away an answer” when
asking a question.</li>
<li>You may discuss homework/lab assignments with classmates as follows:
you can verbally explain to other students the approach you used to
solve a particular problem, without sharing or directly showing your
materials (question, solution, failed attempt, data, figures)
directly.</li>
<li>You may not share your homework/lab with anyone else by email or
other private communication channel. (Not even for “comparison”, not a
partial answer, not an incorrect answer, not even a question variant
with no answer…)</li>
<li>You may not post questions on CourseHero, Chegg, or other sites -
the course Q&amp;A site on Ed is the only place you are allowed to post
questions about homework assignments.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use solved homework or lab assignments from a
previous semester (whether from a friend, or that you find online). (Not
even for “comparison”, not a partial answer, etc…)</li>
<li>You may not <em>attempt</em> to use any unauthorized assistance on
exams. Note that even if your attempt is unsuccessful (e.g. you open
ChatGPT but are “caught” before you can copy and paste a question into
it), you will earn a zero grade on the exam and a record in the Office
of Student Life and Services.</li>
<li>After the class ends, some students like to share their solutions to
programming assignments as part of an online “portfolio”, to show off
their work. However, you may only share the part that you wrote - you
may not share the parts of the “template” (code or text) that were
written by me.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="policy-on-use-of-ai">Policy on use of AI</h4>
<p>You are permitted to use AI assistance for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>computer translation between English and another language, e.g. you
may write an explanation for a homework problem or lab assignment in
another language and then submit a direct translation to English using
Google Translate or a similar service. (Note: this does not include
“cleaning up” or rephrasing text, which is not allowed - only direct
translation is allowed. You shouldn’t “clean up” text because (1) I
don’t care about your spelling, grammar, or vocabulary, and (2) if I am
asking for an open-ended response, I want to hear <em>your</em> voice,
not an LLM’s voice.)</li>
<li>to generate Python code for plotting and visualization. You are
fully responsible for any figures or visualizations you submit,
including making sure their appearance is reasonable and the data in
them is correct. But, you are permitted to use an AI assistant such as
ChatGPT or Gemini to help you generate <code>matplotlib</code> or
<code>seaborn</code> code to make your plots look the way you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of the tasks listed above, AI assistance is not
permitted in this course.</p>
<p>The sequence of assignments in this course is calibrated for human
learners, to gradually learn the content by progressively building on
what they have already mastered. If you use AI on un-proctored
assessments, like homework problem sets and lab assignments, you will
likely find yourself unprepared for the proctored exams, where you are
not allowed to use AI.</p>
<p>Instead of using an AI “tutor” (which often makes subtle mistakes,
and won’t emphasize the things that your instructor wants you to pay
attention to), please use the human assistance that is available to you
in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you answer a question on PrairieLearn, scroll down to the
“Correct Answer” panel. In many cases, this will have an explanation
that is <strong>written by your instructor</strong>.</li>
<li>If you don’t understand something in the lecture, lab, or homework,
post a question on Ed to get an explanation from your instructor or a
course assistant.</li>
<li>Or, visit an office hour on Zoom for a “live” Q&amp;A with
humans.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="violation-of-academic-integrity-policies">Violation of academic
integrity policies</h4>
<p>The course staff wants to spend their time and effort supporting
students who want to learn, not policing students’ avoidance of
learning. However, when we <em>do</em> detect a violation of these
policies (e.g. on grading a manually graded question on a homework or
lab assignment, on “spot checks” of autograded questions, or on manual
review of exams), we take it very seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>on the first instance of a violation of these academic integrity
policies, a zero grade will be applied for the assessment. Also, a
record of the incident will be kept in the Office of Student Life and
Services by the Office of Student Advocacy, as described in the <a
href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct">Student
Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
<li>on a second instance, an F grade will be assigned for the course.
Also, a record of the incident will be kept in the Office of Student
Life and Services by the Office of Student Advocacy, as described in the
<a
href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct">Student
Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By design, the consequence for an academic integrity violation is
always worse than the consequence for not knowing an answer - if you
don’t know an answer to a question, you may earn a zero on just that
question. If you violate the academic integrity policies of the course,
you will earn a zero on the entire assessment (problem set, lab
assignment, or exam).</p>
<h3 id="other-important-policies">Other important policies</h3>
<h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
<p>The NYU Tandon School values an inclusive and equitable environment
for all our students. I hope to foster a sense of community in this
class and consider it a place where individuals of all backgrounds,
beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual
orientations, religious and political affiliations, and abilities will
be treated with respect. It is my intent that all students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak
with me.</p>
<h4 id="disability">Disability</h4>
<p>If you are student with a disability who is requesting
accommodations, please contact New York University’s Moses Center for
Students with Disabilities (CSD) at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.
You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations. Information
about the Moses Center can be found at www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center
is located at 726 Broadway on the 3rd floor.</p>
<p>Note for those who require accommodations for timed assessments: the
exams in this class are timed exams.</p>
<h4 id="illness-or-other-exceptional-situation">Illness or other
exceptional situation</h4>
<p>If you are experiencing an illness or any other situation that might
affect your academic performance in a class, please contact the student
advocate:
https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy
who will reach out to the course instructor on your behalf for
accommodations when warranted.</p>
<p>Students who need an excused absence (e.g. an extended deadline on an
assignment due to illness) should complete the “Excused Absence” form on
the Student Advocacy website.</p>
