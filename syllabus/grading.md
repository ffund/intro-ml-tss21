### Grading

Your overall numeric course grade is determined as follows:

* Homework problem sets: 25%
* Lab assignments: 25%
* Midterm exam: 20%
* Final exam: 30%
* Extra credit: See below

Then, your letter grade is determined according to the following chart:

| Minimum grade required for... | is... |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| A                             | 90    |
| A-                            | 85    |
| B+                            | 82    |
| B                             | 75    |
| B-                            | 70    |
| C+                            | 64    |
| C                             | 60    |


(grades are rounded up if they are within 0.999 of the required grade.) 

The same grading policy is applied to every student, regardless of personal circumstances. There are no opportunities for "extra" work or for personal grading schemes different than the one described above.  If it important to you to earn a specific grade, then it is up to you to make sure the work you submit is at that level.

#### Homework problem sets

There are 10-12 homework problem sets assigned over the course of the semester. These are always due on Sunday at midnight. It is a good idea start working on them well before the due date - make sure to give yourself plenty of time, so that in case you have questions or need help, you have time to ask and get support on Ed well before the assignment is due. Late work will not be graded for credit unless recommended by the student advocate (see "Illness or other exceptional situation").

Most homework problems are automatically graded, so you will have instant feedback regarding your answer (you will know whether it was correct or not, and in many cases, you will see an explanation of the correct answer). You have unlimited attempts to submit your answers for credit before the deadline. Your score will never decrease - once you have earned credit for a question, you keep that credit even you later answer the question incorrectly. After the deadline, you may continue to practice the homework problems, although you won't earn credit.

There are many problem sets over the course of the semester, so each one individually carries relatively little weight. Therefore, if life circumstances on occasion prevent you from fully completing an assignment before the deadline, the impact on your overall course grade will be small. There is also an added element of "forgiveness" in the two lowest problem set grades counting less:

The two lowest grades in the "Homework problem sets" category will be weighted 50%. For example: if you earn [50, 75, 80, 90, 64] on problem sets, your weighted problem set average is [75+80+90+(50+64)/2]/4 = 75.5.

Homework problem sets are expected to take 1-2 hours on average. Some homework problem sets may take less time (e.g. 30 minutes) and some may take more time (e.g. up to 4 hours). If you are less comfortable with the math or programming prerequisites for this course, you may find that homework problem sets take longer than 1-2 hours.

#### Lab assignments

There will be 5 lab assignments over the course of the semester. The average time expected per lab assignment is 7 hours. Some lab assignments will take closer to 4-5 hours and some will take closer to 9-10 hours. Note that lab assignments span more than one week.  

Make sure to give yourself plenty of time, so that in case you have questions or need help, you have time to ask and get support on Ed well before the assignment is due. Late work will not be graded for credit  unless recommended by the student advocate (see "Illness or other exceptional situation").

#### Exams

We will have a midterm exam and a final exam.

On each exam, there will be 100 points that are divided roughly as follows:

* 20-30 points: basic computations. You'll show that you understand the mathematical operations that are carried out by machine learning models, by doing some of these operations yourself.
* 20-30 points: making choices. You'll show that you know how to choose a machine learning model, set it up to align with the problem you are trying to solve, handle the data appropriately, and follow up on initial results with next steps.
* 10-15 points: fundamental facts about machine learning models and how they behave. These questions do not require computation - they will usually be multiple choice, checkbox, or matching question formats.
* 5-10 points: questions about specific case studies, visualizations, and examples in problem sets or lab assignments. These questions are designed to make sure you "take away" what is intended from these materials, rather than just earning whatever "points" are associated with them.
* 30-35 points: code, including one "easy" and one more complicated question. The "complicated" question is designed so that you can earn points progressively, e.g. you can get a small portion of its credit for doing some basic things correct, some more credit for doing slightly more difficult things. To earn full credit, you will need to show an excellent understanding of principles of ML coding.

You will take exams on a computer in a computer lab, with a proctor watching.

<!--
* If you are enrolled in an in-person section of Intro ML, you will take the exam in person.
* If you are enrolled in an online section of Intro ML (in a semester when Intro ML is offered online), you will also take the exam in person, UNLESS:
  * you are not enrolled in any in-person course in NYC this semester - then you may take the exam online, with an online proctor. You will share your screen and a video view of your environment with the proctor.
  * or, if you have another valid reason for requiring online exams, you should discuss this with me in the first week of the semester (before the add/drop deadline).

In addition to the "live" proctoring, you will record your own screen while taking the exam, and you will submit this recording after the end of the exam (this applies to both in person and online exams).
-->

During the exam, you will be permitted to use:

* Blank scrap paper (loose sheets, not in a notebook)
* 2 sheets of 8.5x11 inch-sheet double sided (i.e. 4-page) reference that you have prepared, with whatever you think you will find useful. This reference sheet must be printed or handwritten - you may not use a digital copy. <!-- At the end of your exam, you will submit a photo of your reference sheet along with your exam. -->
* [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) or [Desmos Scientific Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/scientific) (a handheld calculator is not allowed)
* Python only inside the Jupyter environment on the exam - you may not use your own IDE/Python terminal, you may not use Colab.
* the official scikit-learn API reference pages (via https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/index.html)
* the official numpy API reference pages (via https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference)
* the official pandas API reference pages (via https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference)
* the official Pytorch API reference pages  (via https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
* Google Translate (i.e. if you do not understand some question text or instructions during the exam, you may translate it.)

You may not use any other online or offline materials or resources during the exam. You may not use the course handouts or notebooks (except for parts you have copied into your 'reference sheet'). You may not open the homework problem sets on PrairieLearn during the exam. You may not use a handheld calculator or any electronic device except the computer on which you are taking the exam.

#### Extra credit

You will have the opportunity to earn extra credit towards your midterm and final exam scores.  This extra credit will be added to your actual exam score before it is counted in your course grade. For example, if you earn a 92% on your midterm exam and you have 2 points of extra credit toward your midterm, then a 94% score will be counted.

You may earn up to 2 points toward your midterm exam and 6 points toward your final exam.

Extra credit points may be earned by the following activities:

Extra credit points are only awarded in 0.5 point increments - you won't get 0.25 points for participating in half of the polls in a chalkboard lecture, for example.

Any extra credit you earn from Week 1, 2, 3, or 4 will be applied to the midterm exam, but capped at 2 points. Any extra credit you earn from Week 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 will be applied to the final exam, but capped at 6 points. The cap means that even if you miss an opportunity to earn a 0.5 point or two (for example: you are late to class because of subway delays, and miss a poll as a result), you won't be disadvantaged. There are no makeup opportunities for extra credit points,
