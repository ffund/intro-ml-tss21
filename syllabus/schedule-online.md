### Instructor

Fraida Fund ffund@nyu.edu (370 Jay St, Room 936). The best way to reach me is to post on Ed or to visit my office hour (see Brightspace calendar for dates and Zoom links).

### Course assistants

Anup Raj Niroula, Tse Heng Hsueh. The course assistants are available to answer questions in their respective office hours (see Brightspace calendar for dates and Zoom links). They aren't available by email; for written communication with course staff, please use Ed.

### Instruction mode

Online asynchronous (no scheduled meetings - just prerecorded video) <span style="color:red">except for exams, which will be held in person for most students</span>.


### Schedule

* "Chalkboard lecture" video will be released every week on Thursday.
* "Colab lecture" video will be released every week on Friday.
* Homework problem sets will be released on Fridays before 5PM, and will be due 9 days later (on a Sunday) at midnight.
* Lab assignments will be released on Fridays for even-numbered topics (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and will be due 13 days later (on a Thursday) at midnight (except when a midterm or school break intervenes).
* Office hours: See Brightspace calendar for dates and Zoom links

This is *not* a self-paced course - it is designed for students who will keep up with course material on a regular basis, e.g. will usually work through content within a week of its release.

For the Fall 2025 semester, a tentative schedule (subject to change) is:

| Chalkboard Lecture Date   | Topic                                                                  |

* Lab 4: released 9/26, due 10/9
* Lab 6: released 10/10, due 10/30
* Lab 8: released 10/31, due 11/13
* Lab 10: released 11/14, due 12/4


### Time commitment

This is a 3-credit course. During a fall or spring semester, the average student should spend at least 3 hours/week/credit â†’ 9 hours/week for a 3 credit course. A typical week will include:

 - pre-lecture reading/activity (some weeks) or study time (0.5-1 hours)
 - a "chalkboard lecture" about 2-2.5 hours long
 - a "Colab lecture" video about 1.5 hours long
 - a homework problem set (estimated time: 1-2 hours)
 - a lab assignment (estimated time: 2-3 hours per week, i.e. about 6 or 7 hours per lab assignment)

A student who is not very comfortable with the prerequisites may have to spend more time than the estimate above in order to do well.
