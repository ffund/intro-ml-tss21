<p>A neural network with non-linear activation, with one hidden layer and many units in it <em>can</em> approximate virtually any continuous real-valued function, with the right weights. (Refer to the <em>Universal Approximation Theorem</em>.) But (1) it may need a very large number of units to represent the function, and (2) those weights might not be learned by gradient descent - the loss surface is very unfriendly.</p>
<p>Instead of a single hidden layer, if we use multiple hidden layers they can “compose” functions learned by the previous layers into more complex functions - use fewer units, and tends to learn better weights .</p>

<p>Explanation (via <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/01/31/a-blitz-through-classical-statistical-learning-theory/">Boaz Barak</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the model is less than <span class="math inline">\(d_t\)</span> of the polynomial, we are “under-fitting” and will not get good performance. As <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> increases between <span class="math inline">\(d_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we fit more and more of the noise, until for <span class="math inline">\(d=n\)</span> we have a perfect interpolating polynomial that will have perfect training but very poor test performance. When <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> grows beyond <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, more than one polynomial can fit the data, and (under certain conditions) SGD will select the minimal norm one, which will make the interpolation smoother and smoother and actually result in better performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means: in practice, we let the network get big (have capacity to learn complicated data representations!) and use other methods to help select a “good” set of weights from all these candidates.</p>

### Zero-centered outputs

Remember that at each hidden unit, we compute

$\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial w_{j,i}} = \delta_j u_i$ 

where $\delta_j$ is the backpropagation error from the "upstream" nodes.

What happens if the $u_i$ terms are always positive?

::: notes

* To compute the derivative with respect to the weights at the input to a neuron, we compute the "local derivative" and then multiply by the "upstream" "backpropagation error" (scalar).

* The scalar multiplier may be positive or negative.

<section id="vanishing-gradient" class="slide level3">
<h3>Vanishing gradient</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>What happens when you are in the far left or far right part of the sigmoid?</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradient is close to zero</li>
<li>Weight updates are also close to zero</li>
<li>The “downstream” gradients will also be values close to zero! (Because of backpropagation.)</li>
<li>And, when you multiply quantities close to zero - they get even smaller.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the maximum value of the gradient is only 0.25 - so the gradient is always less than 1, and we know what happens if you multiply many quantities less than 1…</p>
<p>The network “learns fastest” when the gradient is large. When the sigmoid “saturates”, it “kills” the neuron!</p>
<p>Same issue with tanh, although that is slightly better - its output is centered at zero, and its gradient has.</p>
<p>(There is also an analagous “exploding gradient” problem when large gradients are propagated back through the network.)</p>

<h3>Dead ReLU</h3>
<p>ReLU is a much better non-linear function:</p>

<li>does not saturate in positive region</li>
<li>very very fast to compute</li>
<li>often converges faster than sigmoid/tanh</li>
</ul>
<p>But, can “die” in the negative region.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>When input is less than 0, the ReLU (and downstream units) is <em>completely</em> dead (not only very small!)</p>
<p>Alternative: <strong>leaky ReLU</strong> has small (non-zero) gradient in the negative region - won’t die.</p>

<li>a normal random value with small <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>?</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Some comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>If weights are all initialized to zero, all the outputs are zero (for any input) - the network won’t learn.</li>
<li>If weights are all initialized to the same constant, we are more prone to “herding” - hidden units all move in the same direction at once, instead of “specializing”.</li>
<li>Large normal random values are bad - you want to be near the non-linear part of the activation function, and avoid exploding gradients.</li>
<li>Small normal random values work well for “shallow” networks, but not for deep networks - it makes the activation function outputs “collapse” toward zero.</li>

<h2>Gradient descent</h2>
<!-- 
### Standard ("batch") gradient descent

For each step $t$ along the error curve:

$$W^{t+1} = W^t - \alpha \nabla L(W^t) = W^t - \frac{\alpha}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \nabla L_i(W^t, \mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$$


Repeat until stopping criterion is met.


### Stochastic gradient descent 

Idea: at each step, compute estimate of gradient using only one randomly selected sample, and move in the direction it indicates.

Many of the steps will be in the wrong direction, but progress towards minimum occurs *on average*, as long as the steps are small.

Bonus: helps escape local minima. 


### Mini-batch (also "stochastic") gradient descent

Idea: In each step, select a small subset of training data ("mini-batch"), and evaluate gradient on that mini-batch. Then move in the direction it indicates.

For each step $t$ along the error curve: 

* Select random mini-batch $I_t\subset{1,\ldots,N}$
* Compute gradient approximation: $g^t = \frac{1}{|I_t|} \sum_{i\in I_t} \nabla L(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i, W)$
* Update parameters: $W^{t+1} = W^t - \alpha^t g^t$


### Comparison: batch size

![Effect of batch size on gradient descent.](../images/grad-descent-comparison.png){ width=50% }


### Why does mini-batch gradient help? (Intuition)

* Standard error of mean over $m$ samples is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{m}}$, where $\sigma$ is standard deviation.
* The benefit of more examples in reducing error is less than linear!
* Example: gradient based on 10,000 samples requires 100x more computation than one based on 100 samples, but reduces SE only 10x.
* Also: memory required scales with mini-batch size.
* Also: there is often redundancy in training set.


### Gradient descent terminology

* Mini-batch size is $B$, training size is $N$
* A training *epoch* is the sequence of updates over which we see all non-overlapping mini-batches
* There are $\frac{N}{B}$ steps per training epoch
* Data shuffling: at the beginning of each epoch, randomly shuffle training samples. Then, select mini-batches in order from shuffled samples.


### Selecting the learning rate


![Choice of learning rate $\alpha$ is critical](../images/learning_rate_comparison.png){ width=55%}

### Annealing the learning rate

One approach: decay learning rate slowly over time, such as 

* Exponential decay: $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 e^{-k t}$
* 1/t decay: $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 / (1 + k t )$ 

(where $k$ is tuning parameter).


### Gradient descent in a ravine (1)

![Gradient descent path bounces along ridges of ravine, because surface curves much more steeply in direction of $w_1$.](../images/ravine-grad-descent.png){width=40%}

### Gradient descent in a ravine (2)

![Gradient descent path bounces along ridges of ravine, because surface curves much more steeply in direction of $w_1$.](../images/ravine-grad-descent2.png){width=40%}


### Momentum (1)

* Idea:  Update includes a *velocity* vector $v$, that accumulates gradient of past steps. 
* Each update is a linear combination of the gradient and the previous updates. 
* (Go faster if gradient keeps pointing in the same direction!)


### Momentum (2)

Classical momentum: for some $0 \leq \gamma_t < 1$,

$$v_{t+1} = \gamma_t v_t - \alpha_t \nabla L\left(W_t\right)$$

so

$$W_{t+1} = W_t + v_{t+1} = W_t  - \alpha_t \nabla L\left(W_t\right) + \gamma_t v_t$$

($\gamma_t$ is often around 0.9, or starts at 0.5 and anneals to 0.99 over many epochs.)


### Momentum: illustrated

![Momentum dampens oscillations by reinforcing the component along $w_2$ while canceling out the components along $w_1$.](../images/ravine-momentum.png){width=50%}

### RMSProp

Idea: Track *per-parameter* EWMA of *square* of gradient, and use it to adapt learning rate. 


$$W_{t+1,i} = W_{t,i} -\frac{\alpha}
{\sqrt {\epsilon + E[g^2]_t }} \nabla L(W_{t,i})$$

where 

$$E[g^2]_t=(1-\gamma)g^2 + \gamma E[g^2]_{t-1}, \quad g = \nabla J(W_{t,i})$$


::: notes

Weights with recent gradients of large magnitude have smaller learning rate, weights with small recent gradients have larger learning rates.


:::


### RMSProp: illustrated (Beale's function)


![Animation credit: Alec Radford. [Link to view animation](https://imgur.com/a/Hqolp).](../images/beale-gradient.gif){width=40%}


::: notes

Due to the large initial gradient, velocity based techniques shoot off and bounce around, RMSProps proceed more like faster SGD.

:::

### RMSProp: illustrated (Long valley)


![Animation credit: Alec Radford. [Link to view animation](https://imgur.com/a/Hqolp). ](../images/long-valley-gradient.gif){width=40%}

::: notes

SGD stalls and momentum has oscillations until it builds up velocity in optimization direction. Algorithms that scale step size quickly break symmetry and descend in optimization direction.

:::

### Adam: Adaptive moments estimation (2014)
 
Idea: Track the EWMA of *both* first and second moments of the gradient, $\{m_t, v_t\}$ at each time $t$. 

If $L_t(W)$ is evaluation of loss function on a mini-batch of data at time $t$, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\{m_t, v_t\}, \mathbb{E}[m_t] \, \, &\approx \, \, \mathbb{E}[\,\nabla \, L_t(W)\,], \mathbb{E}[v_t] \,  \\
                                  \, &\approx \, \, \mathbb{E}\big[\,(\nabla \, L_t(W))^2\,\big]
 \end{aligned}
 $$

Scale $\alpha$ by $\frac{m_t}{\sqrt{v_t}}$ at each step.
