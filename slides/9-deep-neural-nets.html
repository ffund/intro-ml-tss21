<p>A neural network with non-linear activation, with one hidden layer
and many units in it <em>can</em> approximate virtually any continuous
real-valued function, with the right weights. (Refer to the
<em>Universal Approximation Theorem</em>.) But (1) it may need a very
large number of units to represent the function, and (2) those weights
might not be learned by gradient descent - the loss surface is very
unfriendly.</p>
<p>Instead of a single hidden layer, if we use multiple hidden layers
they can “compose” functions learned by the previous layers into more
complex functions - use fewer units, and tends to learn better weights
.</p>

<p>Explanation (via <a
href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/01/31/a-blitz-through-classical-statistical-learning-theory/">Boaz
Barak</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the model is less than
<span class="math inline">\(d_t\)</span> of the polynomial, we are
“under-fitting” and will not get good performance. As <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> increases between <span
class="math inline">\(d_t\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we fit more and more of the noise,
until for <span class="math inline">\(d=n\)</span> we have a perfect
interpolating polynomial that will have perfect training but very poor
test performance. When <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> grows
beyond <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, more than one polynomial
can fit the data, and (under certain conditions) SGD will select the
minimal norm one, which will make the interpolation smoother and
smoother and actually result in better performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means: in practice, we let the network get big (have
capacity to learn complicated data representations!) and use other
methods to help select a “good” set of weights from all these
candidates.</p>

<p>In deep learning, we don’t want to use “smaller” (simpler) models,

finding weights that will generalize.</p>

<p>We won’t talk much about getting more data, but if it’s possible to
get more labeled data, it is almost always the most helpful thing you
can do!</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: JFT-300M, a Google internal dataset for training image

<p>It’s not always possible to get a lot of <em>labeled</em> data for
training a supervised learning model. But sometimes we can use
<em>unlabeled</em> data, which is much easier to get. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In self-supervised learning, the label can be inferred automatically
from the unlabeled data. e.g. GPT is trained to predict “next
word”.</li>
<li>In semi-supervised/weakly-supervised learning learining, we generate
labels (probably imperfectly) for unlabeled data (maybe using a smaller
volume of labeled data to train a model!)</li>

### Zero-centered outputs

Remember that at each hidden unit, we compute

$\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial w_{j,i}} = \delta_j u_i$ 

where $\delta_j$ is the backpropagation error from the "upstream" nodes.

What happens if the $u_i$ terms are always positive?

::: notes

* To compute the derivative with respect to the weights at the input to a neuron, we compute the "local derivative" and then multiply by the "upstream" "backpropagation error" (scalar).

* The scalar multiplier may be positive or negative.

<h2>Gradient descent</h2>
<!-- 
### Standard ("batch") gradient descent

For each step $t$ along the error curve:

$$W^{t+1} = W^t - \alpha \nabla L(W^t) = W^t - \frac{\alpha}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \nabla L_i(W^t, \mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$$


Repeat until stopping criterion is met.


### Stochastic gradient descent 

Idea: at each step, compute estimate of gradient using only one randomly selected sample, and move in the direction it indicates.

Many of the steps will be in the wrong direction, but progress towards minimum occurs *on average*, as long as the steps are small.

Bonus: helps escape local minima. 


### Mini-batch (also "stochastic") gradient descent

Idea: In each step, select a small subset of training data ("mini-batch"), and evaluate gradient on that mini-batch. Then move in the direction it indicates.

For each step $t$ along the error curve: 

* Select random mini-batch $I_t\subset{1,\ldots,N}$
* Compute gradient approximation: $g^t = \frac{1}{|I_t|} \sum_{i\in I_t} \nabla L(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i, W)$
* Update parameters: $W^{t+1} = W^t - \alpha^t g^t$


### Comparison: batch size

![Effect of batch size on gradient descent.](../images/grad-descent-comparison.png){ width=50% }


### Why does mini-batch gradient help? (Intuition)

* Standard error of mean over $m$ samples is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{m}}$, where $\sigma$ is standard deviation.
* The benefit of more examples in reducing error is less than linear!
* Example: gradient based on 10,000 samples requires 100x more computation than one based on 100 samples, but reduces SE only 10x.
* Also: memory required scales with mini-batch size.
* Also: there is often redundancy in training set.


### Gradient descent terminology

* Mini-batch size is $B$, training size is $N$
* A training *epoch* is the sequence of updates over which we see all non-overlapping mini-batches
* There are $\frac{N}{B}$ steps per training epoch
* Data shuffling: at the beginning of each epoch, randomly shuffle training samples. Then, select mini-batches in order from shuffled samples.


### Selecting the learning rate


![Choice of learning rate $\alpha$ is critical](../images/learning_rate_comparison.png){ width=55%}

### Annealing the learning rate

One approach: decay learning rate slowly over time, such as 

* Exponential decay: $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 e^{-k t}$
* 1/t decay: $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 / (1 + k t )$ 

(where $k$ is tuning parameter).

### Gradient descent in a ravine (2)

### Momentum (1)

* Idea:  Update includes a *velocity* vector $v$, that accumulates gradient of past steps. 
* Each update is a linear combination of the gradient and the previous updates. 
* (Go faster if gradient keeps pointing in the same direction!)


### Momentum (2)

Classical momentum: for some $0 \leq \gamma_t < 1$,

$$v_{t+1} = \gamma_t v_t - \alpha_t \nabla L\left(W_t\right)$$

so

$$W_{t+1} = W_t + v_{t+1} = W_t  - \alpha_t \nabla L\left(W_t\right) + \gamma_t v_t$$

($\gamma_t$ is often around 0.9, or starts at 0.5 and anneals to 0.99 over many epochs.)


### Momentum: illustrated

![Momentum dampens oscillations by reinforcing the component along $w_2$ while canceling out the components along $w_1$.](../images/ravine-momentum.png){width=50%}

### RMSProp

Idea: Track *per-parameter* EWMA of *square* of gradient, and use it to adapt learning rate. 


$$W_{t+1,i} = W_{t,i} -\frac{\alpha}
{\sqrt {\epsilon + E[g^2]_t }} \nabla L(W_{t,i})$$

where 

$$E[g^2]_t=(1-\gamma)g^2 + \gamma E[g^2]_{t-1}, \quad g = \nabla J(W_{t,i})$$


::: notes

Weights with recent gradients of large magnitude have smaller learning rate, weights with small recent gradients have larger learning rates.

### RMSProp: illustrated (Beale's function)

::: notes

Due to the large initial gradient, velocity based techniques shoot off and bounce around, RMSProps proceed more like faster SGD.

### RMSProp: illustrated (Long valley)

::: notes

SGD stalls and momentum has oscillations until it builds up velocity in optimization direction. Algorithms that scale step size quickly break symmetry and descend in optimization direction.

:::

### Adam: Adaptive moments estimation (2014)
 
Idea: Track the EWMA of *both* first and second moments of the gradient, $\{m_t, v_t\}$ at each time $t$. 

If $L_t(W)$ is evaluation of loss function on a mini-batch of data at time $t$, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\{m_t, v_t\}, \mathbb{E}[m_t] \, \, &\approx \, \, \mathbb{E}[\,\nabla \, L_t(W)\,], \mathbb{E}[v_t] \,  \\
                                  \, &\approx \, \, \mathbb{E}\big[\,(\nabla \, L_t(W))^2\,\big]
 \end{aligned}
 $$

Scale $\alpha$ by $\frac{m_t}{\sqrt{v_t}}$ at each step.

<!-- 

Why does it work? Some ideas:

* The network is effectively "smaller" when we stop training early, because many units still in linear region of activation.
* Earlier layers (which learn simpler features) and late layers (near the output - used for response mapping) converge to their final weights first. See [Boaz Barak](https://windowsontheory.org/2021/02/17/what-do-deep-networks-learn-and-when-do-they-learn-it/).
