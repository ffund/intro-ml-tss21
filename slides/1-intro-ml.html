<h3>Rule-based vs. data driven problem solving</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The first two were examples of <em>rule-based</em> problem solving. I used my domain knowledge and expertise to establish rules for solving the problem.</li>
<li>The second two were examples of <em>data-driven</em> problem solving. I still used some of my own expertise to establish rules - for example, the structure of the solution - but I used <em>data</em> (and not just data from the current input) to produce the output.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are some benefits of predicting course grade using the data-driven approach?</p>
<ul>
<li>if the “rules” are complicated, may be difficult/error-prone to encode them as a computer program.</li>
<li>it’s easy to update with more experience or if the “world” changes. For example:
<ul>
<li>if over time the quality of admitted students goes up and I give higher grades, the system that predicts the mean of last semester’s scores will “track” with that.</li>
<li>if I didn’t have many students with poor programming background the first semester, but I do the second semester, I will be able to predict their performance better next time.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>What makes this problem a good/bad candidate for ML? Are there reasons <em>not</em> to use ML for this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Much too complex to program a rule-based system for autonomous driving.</li>
<li>ML may not generalize to “weird” situations as well as a <em>human</em> driver would. See e.g. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/autonomous-cars-vs-kangaroos-the-long-furry-tail-of-unlikely-events">Autonomous Vehicles vs. Kangaroos: the Long Furry Tail of Unlikely Events</a> in IEEE Spectrum.</li>
<li>But, ML will not be tired or otherwise impaired the way a human driver might be.</li>
<li>ML may be “tricked” by certain attacks that wouldn’t affect <em>human</em> drivers. See e.g. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/sensors/slight-street-sign-modifications-can-fool-machine-learning-algorithms">Slight Street Sign Modifications Can Completely Fool Machine Learning Algorithms</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/three-small-stickers-on-road-can-steer-tesla-autopilot-into-oncoming-lane">Three Small Stickers in Intersection Can Cause Tesla Autopilot to Swerve Into Wrong Lane</a> in IEEE Spectrum.</li>

<p>Are there reasons not to use ML here?</p>
<ul>
<li>ML may not be explainable or auditable.</li>
<li>ML may perpetuate and/or exacerbate bias in the training data.

<p>Our ultimate ML system will be many steps disconnected from this task:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Our <strong>real-world goal</strong> is to improve the reputation of the department.</li>
<li>Our <strong>real-world mechanism</strong> is to graduate excellent students (which may or may not be the most effective way to achieve the real-world goal).</li>
<li>Our <strong>learning problem</strong> will be to classify applicants as “admit” or “reject” based on some proxy variable (admit decision? GPA at Tandon?) that is available to us. This is obviously several steps removed from graduating excellent students; for example, if we admit strong students but do not educate them well, our graduates won’t be at that high standard.</li>
<li>Our <strong>data representation</strong> is tabular data from applications for admission. The data is probably <strong>noisy</strong>, i.e. the features available do not include all of the factors that go into student success. It also includes elements that are not relevant to student excellence, but our ML model may find patterns in these irrelevant elements, regardless.</li>
<li>Furthermore, there is some underlying bias in the <strong>training data</strong> we have available.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We only have data from students who self-select to apply to NYU Tandon ECE (selection bias),</li>
<li>the profile of applying students will change over time (data drift),</li>
<li>and also will change depending on the model output (feedback loop),</li>
<li>our department standards for admission are likely to change (concept drift),</li>
<li>we are likely to perpetuate some human bias in our model decisions (bias of admissions committee, bias of instructors which affects students’ performance)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>We will make some decision about what <strong>type of model</strong> to use (inductive bias).</li>
<li>Some data will be set aside as training data, and the model results will depend on the <strong>draw of training data</strong>.</li>
<li>We will train the selected model on the data, and may or may not end up with a model that is completely <strong>optimized</strong> on the training data.</li>
<li>We will evaluate our model using some <strong>loss function</strong> that may or many not represent what we really care about.</li>
<li>When we <strong>deploy</strong> our model, its performance in “real life” (even on the specific learning problem - let alone the real-world goal) may be much worse than it was in our evaluation. (This often signals that the training data and “real” data are too dissimilar.)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We want to create an adaptive system that performs well in the wild, but to do so, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a benchmark task, so we have some way to compare different systems.</li>
<li>We typically can’t optimize directly on the benchmark (though there are exceptions, such as when optimizing for playing video games.) Hence we set up the task of optimizing some proxy loss function <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> on some finite samples of training data.</li>
<li>We then run an optimization algorithm whose ostensible goal is to find the <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> that minimizes the loss function over the training data. (<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a set of models, sometimes known as architecture, and sometimes we also add other restrictions such norms of weights, which is known as regularization)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these steps are typically “leaky”. Test performance on benchmarks is not the same as real-world performance. Minimizing the loss over the training set is not the same as test performance. Moreover, we typically can’t solve the loss minimization task optimally, and there isn’t a unique minimizer, so the choice of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> depends on the algorithm.</p>
