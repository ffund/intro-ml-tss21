<ul>
<li>if the “rules” are complicated, may be difficult/error-prone to
encode them as a computer program.</li>
<li>it’s easy to update with more experience or if the “world” changes.
For example:
<ul>
<li>if over time the quality of admitted students goes up and I give
higher grades, the system that predicts the mean of last semester’s
scores will “track” with that.</li>
<li>if I didn’t have many students with poor programming background the
first semester, but I do the second semester, I will be able to predict
their performance better next time.</li>

### Autonomous driving control (1)

![Autonomous vehicle prototype.](../images/1-self-driving.png){ width=50% }

::: notes

What makes this problem a good/bad candidate for ML? Are there reasons *not* to use ML for this?

* Much too complex to program a rule-based system for autonomous driving.
* ML may not generalize to "weird" situations as well as a *human* driver would. See e.g. [Autonomous Vehicles vs. Kangaroos: the Long Furry Tail of Unlikely Events](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/autonomous-cars-vs-kangaroos-the-long-furry-tail-of-unlikely-events) in IEEE Spectrum.
* But, ML will not be tired or otherwise impaired the way a human driver might be.
* ML may be "tricked" by certain attacks that wouldn't affect *human* drivers. See e.g. [Slight Street Sign Modifications Can Completely Fool Machine Learning Algorithms](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/sensors/slight-street-sign-modifications-can-fool-machine-learning-algorithms) and [Three Small Stickers in Intersection Can Cause Tesla Autopilot to Swerve Into Wrong Lane
](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/three-small-stickers-on-road-can-steer-tesla-autopilot-into-oncoming-lane) in IEEE Spectrum.

<h3>Grading students’ GRE/TOEFL essays</h3>

<p>When you applied to grad school, many of you took the GRE and/or
TOEFL and had to write essays as part of these exams. ETS uses an ML
product called “e-rater” alongside human graders to score these
essays.</p>

ML?</p>

<p>The model may learn patterns that create or exacerbate bias.</p>
<p>For example: ETS uses ML software as a “check” on human graders for
the GRE essay. But its system overscores students from mainland China
(by about 1.3/6 points relative to human scorers) and underscores
African Americans (by about 0.8/6 points) and other groups.</p>

<p>Are there reasons not to use ML here?</p>

characteristics of good essays that would be evident to human readers,

<li>This ML system was easily influenced by things like bookshelves in
the background, or wearing a headscarf.</li>
<li>The company that makes the scoring system said: “Just like in a
normal job interview, these factors are taken into account for the
assessment. However, that does not happen on demand. There’s no
pressure, that can appear in talking to real people.” Is this a
satisfactory answer?</li>
<li>See the report by <a

</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: an ML system will “find” meaningless
patterns, if we let it. In this case, the thing we asked the model to
predict is not observable or measurable, and is probably unrelated to
the data we give it. Its scores are not auditable or explainable, and it
may introduce or exacerbate bias.</p>

### Determine severity of injury from knee X-ray 

![Example of a knee X-ray. [Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01192-7)](../images/1-knee-xray.jpeg){ width=35% }

::: notes

* Among patients with a similar X-ray "score" (from expert), Black patients tend to have more pain.
* What if radiologists may miss some sources of pain? (Medical science often comes from very limited study populations.)
* This algorithm was trained to predict patient pain, rather than radiologist's score.
* Reduced "pain disparity" by 43% (does  a better job than radiologists of finding things that "hurt", especially in Black knees!)

**Takeaway**: an ML system can sometimes be *less* biased than an equivalent human system.

<blockquote>
<p>We want to create an adaptive system that performs well in the wild,
but to do so, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a benchmark task, so we have some way to compare different
systems.</li>
<li>We typically can’t optimize directly on the benchmark (though there
are exceptions, such as when optimizing for playing video games.) Hence
we set up the task of optimizing some proxy loss function <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> on some finite samples of
training data.</li>
<li>We then run an optimization algorithm whose ostensible goal is to
find the <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> that
minimizes the loss function over the training data. (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a set of models, sometimes
known as architecture, and sometimes we also add other restrictions such
norms of weights, which is known as regularization)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these steps are typically “leaky”. Test performance on benchmarks
is not the same as real-world performance. Minimizing the loss over the
training set is not the same as test performance. Moreover, we typically
can’t solve the loss minimization task optimally, and there isn’t a
unique minimizer, so the choice of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> depends on the algorithm.</p>

<h3>Example: grad school admissions</h3>
<p>Suppose we want to train an admissions model to improve the quality
of our graduate students, thereby enhancing the reputation of ECE at NYU
Tandon among employers and doctoral programs.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Our ultimate ML system will be many steps disconnected from this
task:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Our <strong>real-world goal</strong> is to improve the reputation of
the department.</li>
<li>Our <strong>real-world mechanism</strong> is to graduate excellent
students (which may or may not be the most effective way to achieve the
real-world goal).</li>
<li>Our <strong>learning problem</strong> will be to classify applicants
as “admit” or “reject” based on some proxy variable (admit decision? GPA
at Tandon?) that is available to us. This is obviously several steps
removed from graduating excellent students; for example, if we admit
strong students but do not educate them well, our graduates won’t be at
that high standard.</li>
<li>Our <strong>data representation</strong> is tabular data from
applications for admission. The data is probably <strong>noisy</strong>,
it’s likely the features available do not include all of the factors
that go into student success. It also includes elements that are not
relevant to student excellence, but our ML model may find patterns in
these irrelevant elements, regardless.</li>
<li>Furthermore, there is some underlying bias in the <strong>training
data</strong> we have available.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We only have data from students who self-select to apply to NYU
Tandon ECE (selection bias),</li>
<li>the profile of applying students will change over time (data
drift),</li>
<li>and also will change depending on the model output (feedback
loop),</li>
<li>our department standards for admission are likely to change (concept
drift),</li>
<li>we are likely to perpetuate some human bias in our model decisions
(bias of admissions committee, bias of instructors which affects
students’ performance)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>We will make some decision about what <strong>type of model</strong>
to use (inductive bias).</li>
<li>Some data will be set aside as training data, and the model results
will depend on the <strong>draw of training data</strong>.</li>
<li>We will train the selected model on the data, and may or may not end
up with a model that is completely <strong>optimized</strong> on the
training data.</li>
<li>We will evaluate our model using some <strong>loss function</strong>
that may or many not represent what we really care about.</li>
<li>When we <strong>deploy</strong> our model, its performance in “real
life” (even on the specific learning problem - let alone the real-world
goal) may be much worse than it was in our evaluation. (This often
signals that the training data and “real” data are too dissimilar.)</li>

## Limitations (recap)


::: notes

We described limitations - 

* ML is just "pattern finding". Sometimes it finds patterns that we want it to find, sometimes it finds patterns that work most of the time, sometimes it finds patterns that are not at all what we wanted it to learn.
* ML system is part of a "leaky pipeline", where all along the path there are disconnects between what we want and what we can realize.


Now we'll look more closely at the *data*, which is key in either case.
