<aside class="notes">
<p>Evaluating a model in production (optimizing metrics) is often not
straightforward, we often don’t have ground truth -</p>
<ul>
<li>Some problems have <strong>natural ground truth labels</strong>: for
example, you can predict how long a customer will wait on hold, then
time how long they actually waited.</li>
<li>Sometimes you can get labels from users, explicitly or implicitly:
for example, you can add a “report not spam” button on emails that were
classified as spam, or you can infer that they are not spam if a user
moves it from spam folder to inbox. (But, response rates may be low.)
(Users labels may not be good - will a user know whether a translation
is acceptable or not?)</li>
</ul>
<p>But, getting labels in production is often problematic -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ML system itself influences outcome</strong>: for example,
you use an ML system to identify students at risk of failing end-of-year
reading exams, to get extra resources to them. At the end of the year,
some students who got extra help passed the exam. Was your prediction
wrong? (In some cases, we might sacrifice some performance with a “held
out” set - e.g. mark 1% of email as “held out” and send <em>all</em> to
user, even those classified as spam, and see what the user does with
it!)</li>
<li><strong>Feedback loop may be long</strong>: for example, you use an
ML system to show users a movie that they may like, and you consider a
recommendation successful if the user then watches the movie. But, they
may watch it hours, days, weeks after it is first recommended! Your
initial inferred label may be premature.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want labeled production data for evaluation, <em>and</em>
potentially for future re-training!</p>

<h3>Data distribution shift</h3>
<p>Between training and production (or later in production), things may
change e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>the environment in which your service operates, changes (sudden or
gradual)</li>
<li>feedback loop: your production service changes the environment</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Example of “something in the other pieces” changing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your model uses a weather API to get temperature as a feature for
input to model. The API changes its default reporting format from
Farenheit to Celsius.</li>
<li>Your credit card expires, so the weather API refuses your requests
and your data processing code automatically fills in a NaN for
temperature features.</li>

<p>Example: you are predicting breast cancer risk given an input feature
<code>age</code>. Your training data comes from a clinic where patients
are evaluated for breast cancer, so that “source” distribution trends
older. However, your model is deployed in a smartphone app and users
trend younger. (But, the probability of a young/old sample getting
breast cancer has not changed.)</p>

<p>In the previous example (breast cancer risk), we would also see label
shift - with younger users, you would see fewer positive samples.</p>
<p>But, we could also have a scenario with label shift but no covariate
shift. Example: a medicine is developed that reduces breast cancer risk
among all age groups. <span class="math inline">\(P(y)\)</span> is
smaller (less breast cancer), but given a positive sample, the
likelihood of being old/young has not changed.</p>

<p>With our previous workflow, it would be very expensive (in
person-hours) to re-train model, so we wouldn’t want to do it as often
as necessary. To make it less “expensive”, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>close the feedback loop: collect data from production</li>
<li>monitor for data/performance problems</li>
<li>automate data → model → service pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>The trigger to re-train model can be time-based, performance-based,
or data-drift-based.</p>
<p>Note that the “deliverable” that the ML team hands off is no longer a
trained model - now it’s source code and/or configuration files defining
a pipeline, that generates the trained model.</p>

network weights)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>How did GPUs become so important for machine learning?</p>
<ul>
<li>GPUs were originally designed to do graphics e.g. for video games -
most of the computations in graphic rendering are linear algebra,
e.g. matrix operations.</li>
<li>Also designed for high <em>data</em> parallelism - compute same
thing on many data elements (e.g. same shading function on many
polygons). (Not like multi-core CPUs which have task parallelism -
compute different functions.)</li>
<li>In early 2000s: shift toward <em>programmable</em> GPUs - NVIDIA
released APIs for general purpose computation on GPU.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary of tradeoffs:</p>
<p>CPU: low cost, low power general computation. GPU: can quickly do a
big linear algebra operation on a bunch of data samples at once.</p>

CASE STUDY: TWITTER/X TIMELINE


This case study comes from the Twitter/X Engineering blog: https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2017/using-deep-learning-at-scale-in-twitters-timelines

Problem framing:

Goal: get users to visit/engage with Twitter more (translates to ad revenue!)
Mechanism: show users a set of the most relevant Tweets first
Model: predict relevance of each tweet to the user
Note the “leaky pipeline” we brought up in Week 1 - the real-world mechanism may not achieve real-world goal to a meaningful extent, the target of learning problem is not exactly the variable we care about.

Features used as input:

from the Tweet itself (not personal): how recent it is, whether it has image or video, number of retweets or likes
from you (personal): how often and how heavily you use Twitter, what Tweets you engaged with (like, RT) in the past
from you + the author (personal): strength of your connection to the author, your past interactions with them
(which of these features can be pre-computed? How frequently must they be updated?)

When and where the model runs:

every time you open the app or refresh timeline, they score every Tweet (since your last visit) from people you follow
service must score large number of Tweets per second
must be fast enough to “instantly” serve Tweets back to the people viewing the timeline
How model quality is measured:

during training: well-defined accuracy metric. But, this doesn’t predict how people will react to those Tweets.
there are no natural ground truth labels.
evaluate models with A/B testing: serve two sets of users with two different models, and see which were more engaged, spent more time on the service, etc.
Also consider operational metrics:

how much better is Model A than Model B? (in A/B testing)
is the better model more costly? (more compute resources, more complicated operation and support)
the pipeline’s ease of use, scalability, and extendability
Additional challenges: missing data

for a given input, some features may be unavailable
Overall considerations: Quality and speed of predictions, resource utilization, maintainability. The highest “quality” model is not necessarily the one that is deployed in production.
