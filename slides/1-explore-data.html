<h2>Garbage in, garbage out</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Any machine learning project has to start with high-quality data.</p>
<p>There is a “garbage in, garbage out” rule: If you use “garbage” to
train a machine learning model, you will only get “garbage” out. (And:
Since you are evaluating on the same data, you might not even realize it
is “garbage” at first! You may not realize until the model is already
deployed in production!)</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>If the exact thing we want to predict is measurable and available to
us in the data, it will be a <em>direct</em> target variable. Sometimes,
however, the thing we want to predict is not measurable or
available.</p>
<p>In this case, we may need to use a <em>proxy</em> variable that
<em>is</em> measurable and available, and is closely related to the
thing we want to predict. (The results will only be as good as the
relationship between the thing we want to predict, and the proxy!)</p>
<p>Since it is expensive to get labeled data, it’s not uncommon for
labels to be either machine-generated, or added by humans who spend very
little time on each sample. See e.g. <a

imagine you train a machine learning model to classify loan

<aside class="notes">
<p>Between January and October 2020, more than 2000 papers were
published that claimed to use machine learning to diagnose COVID-19
patients based on chest X-rays or other radiography. But a later <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00307-0">review</a>
found that “none of the models identified are of potential clinical use
due to methodological flaws and/or underlying biases”.</p>
<p>To train these models, people used an emerging COVID-19 chest X-ray
dataset, along with one or more existing chest X-ray dataset, for
example a pre-existing dataset used to try and classify viral
vs. bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>The problem is that the chest X-rays for each dataset were so
“distinctive” to that dataset, that a neural network could be trained
with high accuracy to classify an image into its source dataset, even
without the lungs showing!</p>

Suppose I ask you to predict the temperature at 8AM tomorrow morning. 

Which is an easier task:

* predict the temperature at 8AM tomorrow, given the temperature at 7AM and at 9AM
* predict the temperature at 8AM tomorrow, given the temperature at 8AM every day in 2023

(this is an example of temporal data leakage.)

Which is an easier task:

* predict the temperature at 8AM tomorrow in Brooklyn, NY, given the temperature for Brooklyn, NY every day in 2023
* predict the temperature at 8AM tomorrow in Brooklyn, NY, given the temperature in Phoenix, AZ and Seattle, WA every day in 2023

(this is an example of non-independence - the training and test samples are from the same person, same location, etc. but the prediction will be about new people or a new location.)


Which is an easier task:

* predict the temperature at 8AM in Brooklyn, NY, for the months of the year with the most consistent temperature
* predict the temperature at 8AM in Brooklyn, NY, for all months of the year

(this is an example of sampling bias - the most difficult cases e.g. borderline cases are excluded from the data.)

What are our assumptions about election night data, and how are they violated here? 

We expect that per-candidate vote totals (computed by multiplying total votes and vote share) should increase as more votes are counted, but never decrease.

What are possible explanations?

### Example: anomalous voting data (2)

![Process by which data is collected by Edison and AP.](../images/1-election2020-process.png){ width=75% }

::: notes

This anomaly makes a lot of sense as a correction of a data entry or duplicate entry error. 

How Edison/AP collects the data for their Election Night feed:

* There are "stringers" (temporary reporters) at various elections offices who call results into their phone center
* They have people who look at official government websites for new results that they manually enter into the system
* They have people who monitor results sent by fax from counties and cities

all working as fast as they can! Data entry and duplicate entry errors are not only likely, they are almost guaranteed. When they are corrected, vote totals may decrease.
