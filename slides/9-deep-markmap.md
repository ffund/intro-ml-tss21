# Finding a "better" optimum

## Dataset

- Get more data
- Data augmentation
- Use related data (transfer learning)
- Use unlabeled data (self-supervised, semi-supervised)

## Architecture/setup

- Activation functions
- Weight initialization
- Skip connections
- Convolutional units
- Recurrent units

## Normalization

- Input standardization
- Batch normalization

## Gradient descent

- Adaptive learning rates
- Gradient clipping

## Regularization

- L2 or L1 regularization
- Early stopping
- Dropout
