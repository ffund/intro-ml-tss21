In retrospect, the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in late spring and summer of 2020 is known. 

In Spring 2020, a number of models were developed to predict the number of COVID-19 deaths over the coming weeks, under various conditions and assumptions (e.g. different levels of restrictions on mobility and other non-pharmaceutical interventions). The predictions of these models varied widely according to their assumptions. For example, models based on the assumption 


In May 2020, an article in the Washington Post referred to a "cubic model"

> Even more optimistic than that [a different model], however, is the "cubic model" prepared by Trump adviser and economist Kevin Hassett. People with knowledge of that model say it shows deaths dropping precipitously in May â€” and essentially going to zero by May 15.

This attracted some attention. Shortly afterward, Kevin Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisors clarified that the model was indeed ["just a canned function in Excel, a cubic polynomial"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/business/coronavirus-white-house-economists.html), but that it was for [data visualization purposes](https://twitter.com/WhiteHouseCEA45/status/1257680258364555264) and wasn't intended to be a projection of future deaths.
