A classic example of a problem that has traditionally been easy for humans, but difficult for computers, is handwritten digit recognition. Because of the many variations in human handwriting, early attempts to "read" handwritten digits into a computer were very limited. It's very difficult to give a computer "rules" - for example, that all samples where specific pixels are marked must be a certain digit.

It therefore seemed almost "magical" when, at the 1964 World's Fair in New York, IBM unveiled an amazing computer system that *read handwritten dates* off a small card. Visitors to the "This Date in History" exhibit would write down a date on a card and feed it into the machine.

Then, the computer convert the handwritten date into digital form, look up the date in a database of New York Times headlines, and show a headline from that day on an overhead display. Watch the first minute of this video to see a demonstration:

The results were also printed on a card that you could keep as a souveneir!
