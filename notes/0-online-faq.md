### Will we have live meetings? Is this course synchronous or asynchronous? 

This course includes both synchronous and asynchronous content. 
We will have a weekly live meeting on Zoom for a "chalk talk", and you 
will also have to watch a weekly pre-recorded video of a 
programming/demo session.  Some weeks may also have asynchronous 
pre-lecture content that you should watch or read *before* the live meeting.


### Am I required to attend the live meetings, or can I watch a recording later?

The live meetings will be recorded. However, you will be required to attend the final 
exam session at the live meeting time.


### How can I get help or ask questions about the course material?

There are two ways to get help:

* Post a question on the Q&A forum for this course.
* Attend a Zoom office hours session with the instructor.

Note that you can ask questions **anonymously** on the Q&A forum, if you feel more comfortable that way.

### What are the prerequisites for this course? 

This course is mathematically oriented, and undergraduate-level
knowledge of probability and linear algebra is required.

If you want to brush up, you can review:

-   [Review of probability
    theory](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf) (http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)
-   In [Boyd & Vandenberghe "Introduction to Applied Linear
    Algebra"](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf) (http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf), these sections:
    -   Section I, Chapter 1 (Vectors): vectors, vector addition,
        scalar-vector multiplication, inner product (dot product)
    -   Section I, Chapter 3 (Norm and distance):  Norm of a vector,
        euclidean distance 
    -   Section II, Chapter 5 (Matrices): matrix notation, zero and
        identity matrices, sparse matrices, matrix transposition, matrix
        addition, scalar-matrix multiplication, matrix norm,
        matrix-vector multiplication
    -   Section II, Chapter 8 (Linear equations): systems of linear
        equations
    -   Section II, Chapter 10 (Matrix multiplication): matrix-matrix
        multiplication
    -   Section II, Chapter 11 (Matrix inverses): Inverse, solving a
        system of linear equations
    -   Also a quick optimization review: Appendix C (Derivatives and
        optimization)

There will be a significant programming component to this course, and
class and homework exercises will be in Python. You do not need to know
Python a priori, but you should know basic programming concepts and have
experience programming in some programming language. We will review 
some important Python basics in the first week of the course.

### Do I need previous experience with machine learning for this course? 

This is an introductory graduate level course and no prior machine
learning knowledge will be assumed. If you already have significant ML
experience, there is no need to take this class.

### Do I need a computer with a GPU? Will I have to install some software on my computer? 

In this course, we will use the Google Colab environment for practical
programming demos and exercises. Colab is a free browser-based
environment for Python programming. You don't need to install anything
to use Colab - you'll just need a browser.

### Do I need a textbook for this course?

You won't need to buy a textbook - all of the materials you'll need
will be posted on the course site.

### The course includes a project. Can I do the project on whatever topic I want? 

Not exactly. For your project, I'm going to ask you to replicate and
then build on a recently published result from a top machine learning
conference. I'll give you a list of published papers (with code!) to
choose from, in various areas of ML:

-   Understanding images
-   Generating images
-   Understanding text
-   Generating text
-   Audio (speech)
-   Audio (music and other sounds)
-   Security and robustness
-   Reinforcement learning
-   ML and society: Fairness, privacy, explainability

You'll choose your project from that list of papers.


### What should I do if I need extra time on an assignment because of illness, religious practice, or a death in the immediate family?

If you need extra time on an assignment because of illness (including COVID-19), religious practice, or a death in the immediate family, please contact the student advocate. 

The student advocate will reach out to your professors directly to recommend excused absences or extended deadlines, so you do not need to share any details of your personal circumstance with me.



### What should I do if I need extra time on an assignment or exam because of a disability?

If you need extra time on an assignment or exam because of a disability (for example: you need to take frequent breaks from a computer screen because of a vision problem, or you have an executive function disorder), you will need to work with the Moses Center to request accommodations beyond the “48 free late hours”. Please refer to the “Moses Center Statement of Disability” section.

(Note that disability accommodations are not retroactive, so you should begin this process at the beginning of the semester if you think you may need it, rather than waiting until you are already struggling.)

The Moses Center will reach out to your professors directly if your accommodations are approved, so you do not need to share any details of your disability with me.
