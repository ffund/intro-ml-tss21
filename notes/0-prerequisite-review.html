<h2 id="prerequisite-review">Prerequisite review</h2>
<p>This course is mathematically oriented, and undergraduate-level knowledge of probability and linear algebra is a prerequisite. If you need to brush up, here’s what you should review:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf">Review of Probability Theory</a> (http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)</li>
<li>In <a href="http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf">Boyd and Vandenberghe “Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra”</a> (http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf):
<ul>
<li>Section I, Chapter 1 (Vectors): vectors, vector addition, scalar-vector multiplication, inner product (dot product)</li>
<li>Section I, Chapter 3 (Norm and distance): Norm of a vector, euclidean distance</li>
<li>Section II, Chapter 5 (Matrices): matrix notation, zero and identity matrices, sparse matrices, matrix transposition, matrix addition, scalar-matrix multiplication, matrix norm, matrix-vector multiplication</li>
<li>Section II, Chapter 8 (Linear equations): systems of linear equations</li>
<li>Section II, Chapter 10 (Matrix multiplication): matrix-matrix multiplication</li>
<li>Section II, Chapter 11 (Matrix inverses): Inverse, solving a system of linear equations</li>
<li>Also a quick optimization review: Appendix C (Derivatives and optimization)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
