This course is mathematically oriented, and undergraduate-level knowledge of probability and linear algebra is a prerequisite. If you need to brush up, here's what you should review:


* [Review of Probability Theory](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf) (http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)
* In [Boyd and Vandenberghe "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra"](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf) (http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf):
  * Section I, Chapter 1 (Vectors): vectors, vector addition, scalar-vector multiplication, inner product (dot product), complexity of vector computations
  * Section I, Chapter 3 (Norm and distance):  Norm of a vector, euclidean distance, complexity
  * Section II, Chapter 5 (Matrices): matrix notation, zero and identity matrices, sparse matrices, matrix transposition, matrix addition, scalar-matrix multiplication, matrix norm, matrix-vector multiplication, complexity
  * Section II, Chapter 8 (Linear equations): systems of linear equations
  * Section II, Chapter 10 (Matrix multiplication): matrix-matrix multiplication
  * Section II, Chapter 11 (Matrix inverses): Inverse, solving a system of linear equations
  * Also a quick optimization review: Appendix C (Derivatives and optimization)
  * And a brief introduction to algorithm complexity: Appendix B (Complexity)
